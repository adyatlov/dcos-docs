DC/OS is capable of running many different kinds of workloads. All workloads are composed of tasks.

DC/OS tasks are [Mesos tasks](/docs/1.9/overview/concepts/#mesos-task) that have been scheduled by either a DC/OS built-in scheduler or a scheduler service running on DC/OS.

DC/OS has two built-in schedulers: Marathon (services) and Metronome (jobs). Additional schedulers can be installed as [scheduler services](/docs/1.9/overview/concepts/#dcos-scheduler-service) on Marathon, either from the [Mesosphere Universe](/docs/1.9/overview/concepts/#mesosphere-universe) or directly via Marathon.

Task types are determined by the [Mesos Executor](/docs/1.9/overview/concepts/#mesos-executor) that executes them, which is specified by the [scheduler](/docs/1.9/overview/concepts/#dcos-scheduler) that schedules them. In Mesos, the scheduler is called a [framework](/docs/1.9/overview/concepts/#mesos-framework), but that term is confusing within the broader context of DC/OS. So we just use the terms "scheduler", "executor", and "task" explicitly.

Mesos has a couple built-in executors that are available to all schedulers, but schedulers may also bring their own executors.

Built-in executors:

- Command Executor - execute shell commands or Docker containers
- Default Executor (Mesos 1.1) - execute a group of shell commands or Docker containers

For more on Mesos executors, see the [Mesos Framework Development Guide](https://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/app-framework-development-guide/)

Because the task system is so generic, users do not generally create or interact with tasks directly. Instead, schedulers often provide higher level abstractions.

Examples of scheduler abstractions:

- The Marathon scheduler provides **services** (Apps and Pods), which run continuously and in parallel.
- The Metronome scheduler provides **jobs**, which run immediately or on a defined schedule.
- The Kakfa scheduler provides **Kakfa brokers**, which run as lifecycle managed Kafka nodes.
- The Cassandra scheduler provides **Cassandra nodes**, which run as lifecycle managed Cassandra nodes.
- The Spark scheduler (dispatcher) provides **Spark jobs**, which are themselves schedulers for Spark tasks.

For more on Marathon services, see [Service Management with Marathon](/docs/1.9/usage/marathon/) or the [Marathon docs](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/).

For more on Metronome jobs, see the [Metronome docs](/docs/1.9/usage/jobs/).
