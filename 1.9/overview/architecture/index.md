DC/OS is a software platform on which user software runs. This platform layer runs on top of the infrastructure layer. The infrastructure layer is composed of virtual or physical hardware including compute, storage, and networking.

![DC/OS Architecture Layers](/docs/1.8/overview/architecture/img/dcos-architecture-layers.png)

## Software Layer

At the software layer, DC/OS provides package management and a package repository to easily install and manage multiple types of services: databases, message queues, stream processors, artifact repositories, monitoring solutions, continuous integration tools, source control management, log aggregators, etc. In addition to these packaged apps and services, the user may install their own custom apps, services, and scheduled jobs. For more information, see [Primitives](/docs/1.8/overview/architecture/primitives/).

## Platform Layer

At the platform layer, there are dozens of components grouped into categories: cluster management, container orchestration, logging & metrics, networking, package management, security, and storage. For more information, see [Components](/docs/1.8/overview/architecture/components/).

These components are divided amongst multiple node types: master nodes, private agent nodes, and public agent nodes. For more information, see [Node Types](/docs/1.8/overview/architecture/node-types/).

In order for DC/OS to be installed, each node must already be provisioned with one of the supported host operating systems. For more information, see [Host Operating System](/docs/1.8/overview/concepts/#host-operating-system).

## Infrastructure Layer

At the infrastructure layer, DC/OS can be installed on public clouds, private clouds, or on-premises hardware. Some of these install targets have automated provisioning tools, but almost any infrastructure can be used, as long as it includes multiple x86 machines on a shared IPv4 network. For more information, see [Installing](/docs/1.8/administration/installing/).

## External Components

In addition to the software that runs in the datacenter, DC/OS includes and integrates with several external components: the [GUI](/docs/1.8/usage/webinterface/), [CLI](/docs/1.8/usage/cli/), [package repository](/docs/1.8/usage/repo/), and [container registry](/docs/1.8/overview/concepts/#container-registry).
